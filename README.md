A detailed map into my repositories for my CV<br>
This file contains 3 web application, 1 C arduino embedded app, 2 console games and 3 python desktop apps.<br><br>

1-<br>
 A relativily complex camp reservation Web application:<br>
   https://github.com/abdullah-mohamed/yelpcampApp<br>
 In this app, I followed REST convention for routes and nested routes, used nodejs as server, mongoDB as database, Express as framework,  bootstrap for styling(Although I inserted many inline-styling), simple MV(model-view) structure, many js-libraries:<br>
  - 'passportjs' for userAuthentication, hashing,.. .
  - 'express-session' for user sessions.
  - 'express-sanitizer' for i/p sanitizing.
  - 'connect-flash' for flash messages.
  - 'method-override' for handling PUT & DELETE requests.
  - 'body-parser' for embedding form information into request objects.<br>
This app, its topics and more web-technologies are explained in this highly-rated 43-hour udemy course which I finished:<br>

2-<br>
 A simple blog App:<br>
   https://github.com/abdullah-mohamed/blogapp<br>
 In this app, I followed REST convention, used nodejs as server, mongoDB as database, Express as framework, SemanticUI for styling.<br>

3-<br>
  A fun patatap clone:<br>
   https://github.com/abdullah-mohamed/patatap-clone2<br>
 In this app, I used jquery, nodejs as server and simple css, this is the original app:<br>
   https://patatap.com/<br>

4-<br>
  A relativily complex arduino chess board:<br>
   https://github.com/abdullah-mohamed/chess_arduino_mega<br>
 In this app, I used C language to program an arduino-mega to detect physical movements on a board using sensors and then send these  data to an arduino-uno which calculates the possible <bold> Correct </bold> moves for the moved piece and show them to the player using LEDs.<br>
 The project only shows the possible moves for both human-players.<br>
 This app, its topics and logic are all self-learn acquired. It was a science project that I made in college but unfortunately I never finished.<br><br>
 
 
5-<br>
 A tic-tac-toe console game:<br>
   https://github.com/abdullah-mohamed/Tic-Tac-Toe<br>
 In this app, I used C language to create a Correct-logic for a Tic-Tac-Toe game.<br>
 This app, its topics and logic are all self-learn acquired. I made it for fun. I always enjoyed building logic for games.<br><br>
 
 
6-<br>
 A sudoku simple solver:<br>
   https://github.com/abdullah-mohamed/sudoku<br>
 In this app, I used C# language to create a Correct-logic application to solve any midlevel sudoku game.<br>
 <strong>This app is really one of my all time favs as I am a huge sudoku fan and player.</strong>
 This app, its topics and logic are all self-learn acquired.<br><br>

 7-<br>
   A weather statistics app:<br>
     https://github.com/abdullah-mohamed/weather-statistics<br>
  In this app, I used pyhton heavily, used many libraries to calculate the mean, and other values for a set of data between 2 user-provided periods of time, The data is supposed to be fetched from the web but I accessed it locally and used <strong>MySQL</strong> for a database.<br><br>
 
 8-<br>
   A simple car speed dashboard app:<br>
     https://github.com/abdullah-mohamed/car-dashboard<br>
  In this app, I used python to imitate the behavior of car dashboard, this is supposed to run on a rasberry pi board connected on an electric car. <br>
 This app, its topics and logic are all self-learn acquired.<br>
 But I first learnt bython following this path:<br>

 9-<br>
  A simple CRUD console application:<br>
    https://github.com/abdullah-mohamed/CRUD-app<br>
 In this app, I used python to imitate the CRUD DB utilities on making files.<br>
 It was made for a college project as we were told to solve a real world problem using what we have learned, I had much fun building it.<br>
