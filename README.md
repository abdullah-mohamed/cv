1-<br>
 A relativily complex camp reservation Web application:<br>
   https://github.com/abdullah-mohamed/yelpcampApp<br>
 In this app, I followed REST convention for routes and nested routes, used nodejs as server, mongoDB as database, Express as framework,  bootstrap for styling(Although I inserted many inline-styling), simple MV(model-view) structure, many js-libraries:<br>
  - 'passportjs' for userAuthentication, hashing,.. .
  - 'express-session' for user sessions.
  - 'express-sanitizer' for i/p sanitizing.
  - 'connect-flash' for flash messages.
  - 'method-override' for handling PUT & DELETE requests.
  - 'body-parser' for embedding form information into request objects.<br>
This app, its topics and more web-technologies are explained in this highly-rated 43-hour udemy course which I finished:<br>
  https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/<br><br>
  
2- <br>
 A budget app using vanilla JS: <br>
    https://github.com/abdullah-mohamed/budgetApp.git
It's a quite simple app but the architechture is beautiful -at least for me-, as I used the module pattern for the first time.

3-<br>
 A simple blog App:<br>
   https://github.com/abdullah-mohamed/blogapp<br>
 In this app, I followed REST convention, used nodejs as server, mongoDB as database, Express as framework, SemanticUI for styling.<br>
 This app, its topics and more web-technologies are explained in this highly-rated 43-hour udemy course which I finished:<br>

4-<br>
 A fictional food company website: <br>
    https://github.com/abdullah-mohamed/omnifood-restaurant<br>
 It's my first <strong><em>responsive</em></strong> website, just HTML and CSS only.
 This app, its topics were covered in this 12-hour Udemy course:<br>
     https://www.udemy.com/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/

5-<br>
  A fun patatap clone:<br>
   https://github.com/abdullah-mohamed/patatap-clone2<br>
 In this app, I used jquery, nodejs as server, simple css and js libraries:<br>
  - Howlerjs for sounds.
  - paperjs for animations.<br><br>
 This is the original app:<br>
   https://patatap.com/<br>

6-<br>
  A relativily complex arduino chess board:<br>
   https://github.com/abdullah-mohamed/chess_arduino_mega<br>
 In this app, I used C language to program an arduino-mega to detect physical movements on a board using sensors and then send these  data to an arduino-uno which calculates the possible <bold> Correct </bold> moves for the moved piece and show them to the player using LEDs.<br>
 The project only shows the possible moves for both human-players.<br>
 This app, its topics and logic are all self-learn acquired. It was a science project that I made in college but unfortunately I never finished.<br><br>
 
 
7-<br>
 A tic-tac-toe console game:<br>
   https://github.com/abdullah-mohamed/Tic-Tac-Toe<br>
 In this app, I used C language to create a Correct-logic for a Tic-Tac-Toe game.<br>
 This app, its topics and logic are all self-learn acquired. I made it for fun. I always enjoyed building logic for games.<br><br>
 
 
8-<br>
 A sudoku simple solver:<br>
   https://github.com/abdullah-mohamed/sudoku<br>
 In this app, I used C# language to create a Correct-logic application to solve any midlevel sudoku game.<br>
 <strong>This app is really one of my all time favs as I am a huge sudoku fan and player.</strong>
 This app, its topics and logic are all self-learn acquired.<br><br>

 9-<br>
   A weather statistics app:<br>
     https://github.com/abdullah-mohamed/weather-statistics<br>
  In this app, I used pyhton heavily, used many libraries to calculate the mean, and other values for a set of data between 2 user-provided periods of time, The data is supposed to be fetched from the web but I accessed it locally and used <strong>MySQL</strong> for a database.<br><br>
 
 10-<br>
   A simple car speed dashboard app:<br>
     https://github.com/abdullah-mohamed/car-dashboard<br>
  In this app, I used python to imitate the behavior of car dashboard, this is supposed to run on a rasberry pi board connected on an electric car. <br>
 This app, its topics and logic are all self-learn acquired.<br>
 But I first learnt bython following this path:<br>

 11-<br>
  A simple CRUD console application:<br>
    https://github.com/abdullah-mohamed/CRUD-app<br>
 In this app, I used python to imitate the CRUD DB utilities on making files.<br>
 It was made for a college project as we were told to solve a real world problem using what we have learned, I had much fun building it.<br>
 This app, its topics and logic are all self-learn acquired.<br>
